# Overview of Integrating Customized Databases

Using customized databases can satisfy these use cases:

- **Use your own databases to store user information**: You can use your own database to store user information. In this mode, {{$localeConfig.brandName}} won't store any user information.
- **Migrate user information to {{$localeConfig.brandName}} with lazy migration**: In **lazy migration** mode, all user information will be stored in your database at the beginning. When a user try to login through Approw, the Approw will search and authenticate the user in the database with customized script and will migrate this user to Approw if authenticate succeeds. When this user login Approw at the second time, he/she will be authenticated with Approw's database. After all users in your database at least login to Approw for one time, the migration is completed. More details can be found in document of [achieving lazy migration with customized database](./lazy-migration.md).

You can setup customized databases with these methods: Go to the [Approw Console](https://console.approw.com/console/userpool) then find **Connect IdP** - **Customized Database** to setup customized database connection. More details can be found in document about [how to setup customized database](./configuration/README.md).

## How it Works

As the figure shows below, you can setup customized database and get users' identity information through Legacy Database in the Approw authentication flow. The flow will be a little bit different according to different user cases.

There are two ways to setup customized database to fit different user cases:

- **Migrate user information to Approw with lazy migration**: In **lazy migration** In lazy migration mode, all user information will be stored in your database at the beginning. When a user try to login through Approw, the Approw will search and authenticate the user in the database with customized script and will migrate this user to Approw if authenticate succeeds. When this user login Approw at the second time, he/she will be authenticated with Approw's database. After all users in your database at least login to Approw for one time, the migration is completed. More details can be found in document of [achieving lazy migration with customized database](./lazy-migration.md).
- **Only use customized databases to store user information**: You can use your own database to store user information. In this mode, Approw won't store any user information. However you need to deploy scripts for user management to make the system work normally.

## Operating Environment

The current operating environment for Approw customized database script is an isolated sandbox instance based on `node 12` environment.

### The npm Module

The npm module has several ways to connect databases like Client, axios, bcrypt and lodash, etc.

- [bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js): The bcrypt can be used to encrypt and validate passwords, which is also our recommanded way to encrypt passwords and is convenient to use:

```javascript
const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password)
if (!isPasswordValid) {
  throw new Error('The password is wrong.')
}
```

- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): The axios is the most common network request library in Node.JS.
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/) v4.
- [pg](https://node-postgres.com/): The Node PostgresQL Driver.
- [mongodb](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/): The Node Mongodb Driver.
- [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2): The Node MySQL Driver.
- [mssql](https://github.com/tediousjs/node-mssql): The Node Sql Server Driver.

## Add Approw IP Address to Your Whitelist

<!-- If the server that your script tries to access has a firewall, please add these IP addresses to its whitelist: 140.179.19.50 and 52.80.250.250. You can also get Approw external IP address from this API: [https://core.approw.com/api/v2/system/public-ips](https://core.approw.com/api/v2/system/public-ips). -->
If the server that your script tries to access has a firewall, please add these IP addresses to its whitelist: 140.179.19.50 and 52.80.250.250. You can also get Approw external IP address from our Endpoint.
