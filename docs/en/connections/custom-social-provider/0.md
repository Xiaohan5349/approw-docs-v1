### Setup Basic Configurations for the Application

Go to **Approw Console** > **Connect Identity Provider** > **Social Authentication**, find "Connect Customized Social Provider" at the bottom, then click "+" at the right hand side.

In the jump-out window, you need to setup some basic connection information such as link identifier, display name and an application Logo.

### Setup Basic Information for Identity Provider

Next, you need to fill some basic information for customized social provider. You can find corressponding endpoint URLs in ythe OAuth 2.0 document of your social provider such as **Authorization Endpoint**, **Token Endpoint** and **Avaliable Scopes**. Your also need the **Client ID** and **Client Password** of your OAuth 2.0 social provider which can be find in your social provider's configurations.

::: hint-info
Although "Scope" is optional in this sheet, some OAuth 2.0 social provider may require this parameter. You had better setup configurations for this part.
:::

**Authroziation URL template** is an string template, you can use these macros `${authEndPoint}`, `${tokenEndPoint}`, `${scope}`, `${clientId}` and `${clientSecret}`.

Here is the relationships between macros and settings:

| Macro                 | Settings    |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| `${authEndPoint}`  | Authorization URL  |
| `${tokenEndPoint}` | Token URL |
| `${scope}`         | Scope     |
| `${clientId}`      | Client ID   |
| `${clientSecret}`  | Client Password |

For example, 

If you use following link as your authorization URL template:

```
${authEndPoint}?client_id=${clientId}&response_type=code&state=4634641&scope=${scope}&redirect_uri=https://core.approw.com/connections/oauth2/5fa91b0f50315451dc86086d/callback
```

The authorization URL will be:

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/8f909eb1-99fe-4f75-b4e0-2f7ab37815c6/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=fc52a7ab-4172-4db3-9292-e51f85a1576e&response_type=code&state=4634641&scope=openid profile&redirect_uri=https://core.approw.com/connections/oauth2/5fa91b0f50315451dc86086d/callback
```

### Upload Customized Code

Finally, you need to upload cutomized code part to complete functions of **using Code to exchange for the Token** and **using Token to exchange for user profiles and mapping them**.

Approw also provides template codes for you:

You can use the package called [request-promise](https://github.com/request/request-promise) in your function to send network requests.

#### codeToToken Function

Here is the template code of `codeToToken` funcation, The first parameter in the fucntion called **code** is the authorization code, you need to use this **code** to exchange for the AccessToken from your OAuth 2.0 social provider's **Token endpoint**.

```js
async function codeToToken(code, connection) {
  const options = {
    method: 'POST',
    uri: 'Social OAuth2.0 IdP Token Endpoint',
    form: {
      client_id: 'Client ID of your Social OAuth2.0 IdP',
      client_secret: 'Client credential of your Social OAuth2.0 IdP',
      grant_type: 'authorization_code',
      redirect_uri: 'https://core.approw.com/connections/oauth2/{Link_ID}/callback',
      code,
    },
    json: true,
  };
  const resp = await request(options);

  // Return the value of AccessToken from here.
  return resp.access_token;
}
```

#### tokenToUserInfo Function

Here is the template of the `tokenToUserInfo` function, the first parameter called **accessToken** is the return value of the last function **codeToToken** which is  `resp.access_token` in this example, you need to use **accessToken** to exchange the user information from the **Information Endpoint** of your social OAuth2.0 provider and then you need to map these fields. The return value of this function is an object, the contant must be **user information fields that support Approw information format**, and it also has to contain a field called **userIdInIdp**. The content of this field should be **the only identifier of the user in your OAuth2.0 social provider**, which is the user ID.

```js
async function tokenToUserInfo(accessToken, connection) {
  const options = {
    method: 'POST',
    uri: 'User Information Enpoint of Your Social OAuth2.0 Provider',
    form: {
      access_token: accessToken,
    },
    json: true,
  };
  const resp = await request(options);

  // mapping field
  const profile = {
    // The userIdInIdp must be included in the fields.
    userIdInIdp: resp.sub,
    name: resp.name,
    familyName: resp.family_name,
    givenName: resp.given_name,
    photo: resp.picture,
  };
  return profile;
}
```

Please mapping user profile to following fields, the return value of `tokenToUserInfo` funcion must be an object, and the key in this object must be included in the following table. Here is the definition of Approw user information fields:

| Field            | Type    | Definition           |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------------- |
| username          | string  | Username         |
| email             | string  | Email address           |
| emailVerified     | boolean | If the email address is verified   |
| phone             | string  | Phone number         |
| phoneVerified     | boolean | If the phone number is verified |
| birthdate         | string  | Birthday           |
| familyName        | string  | Surname           |
| gender            | string  | Gender           |
| locale            | string  | Country           |
| middleName        | string  | Middle name       |
| givenName         | string  | Given name             |
| nickname          | string  | Nickname           |
| photo             | string  | Link of user's photo       |
| profile           | string  | Link of user's profile |
| preferredUsername | string  | User's perferred username   |
| updatedAt         | Date    | Update date       |
| website           | string  | Personal website       |
| zoneinfo          | string  | Time zone           |

Finally click "Save" to save all configuraitons. For now, you have setup all Customized Social Authentication. Next, we will test the authentication flow using our cutomized social authentication connection.
