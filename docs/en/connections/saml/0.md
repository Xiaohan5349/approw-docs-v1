<IntegrationDetailCard title="Create SAML IdP">

Make sure your SAML IdP supports Service Provider-initiated flow. And prepare following information from your SAML IdP.

> Have a try on Github Open Source [SAML Identity Provider](https://github.com/mcguinness/saml-idp).

- IdP Issuer URI — Usually is the SAML Identity Provider `entityID` in `EntityDescriptor`.
- IdP Single Sign-On URL — SAML Identity Provider endpoint for Approw requests.
- IdP Signature Certificate — SAML Identity Provider public key to verify PEM or DER in SAML Messages.

In certain scenarios, `Issuer URI`, `Single Sign-On URL`, `Signature Certificate` may be only available after you upload metadata (ACS URL, Audience URI). However ACS URL and Audience URI only available after the Approw is created. Please proceed to step 2 if you are facing this issue.
