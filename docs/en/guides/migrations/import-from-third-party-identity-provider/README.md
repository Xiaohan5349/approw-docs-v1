# Import Users from Third-party Identity Sources 

<LastUpdated/>


If you belong to an internal employee usage scenario（[EIAM](/concepts/ciam-and-eiam.md)）, you can import organization and user directories from the following third-party identity sources:

- [LDAP Server](/guides/org/create-or-import-org/?import-org=ldap#导入组织机构)
- [Windows local Active Directory](/guides/org/create-or-import-org/?import-org=active-directory#导入组织机构)

You can read the detailed guideline separately by clicking on the links.
