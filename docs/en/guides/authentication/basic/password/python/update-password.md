If a user doesn't set a password before (for example, register by phone number or social IDP), this method does not require the original password.

```python
# registered by ohone number or social register, so user doesn't set a password in first time use. Leave old_password empty.
authentication_client.update_password(
  new_password="passw0rd",
)
```

authentication_client.update_password(
  new_password="passw0rd",
  old_password="123456!"
)
```
