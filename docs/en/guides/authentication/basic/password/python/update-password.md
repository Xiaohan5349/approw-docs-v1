If a user doesn't set a password before (for example, register by phone number or social IDP), this method does not require the original password.

```python
# registered by ohone number or social register, so user doesn't set a password in first time use. Leave old_password empty.
=======
If the user has not set a password before (for example, registered by mobile phone number, social login, etc.), there is no need to pass in the original password.

```python
# If you register by other methods such as mobile phone number, social login, etc., the password is not set for the first time, and the old_password is left blank.

  new_password="passw0rd",
